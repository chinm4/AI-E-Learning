# AI-E-Learning
This project focuses on creating a platform that  utilizes AI for improved learning and blockchain for  holding certificates and documentation. The platform will be geared towards grades K-12,  with the main goal being to generate the most  efficient learning experience for each user.

AI Component:
Personalized experience for each user.
Machine learning will be used to determine which courses a student will likely excel in based on correlations.
Supervised learning will be used initially, and reinforcement learning will be used after users populate the AI E-Learning module.
Correlation between proficiencies in each subject will be a baseline, user data will be used to recommend courses that a similar user exceled in.
The ideal “similar user” will have identical learning habits and class taking skills as a user.
Use data from “similar user” to predict where user will struggle and where user will succeed.
Slow work on struggling classes until proficient.
Accelerate the student in their proficiencies.

Blockchain Component:
Blockchain will be utilized through certificate storage using smart contracts.
Certificates will be course completion certificates as reference for prerequisites.
A diploma will be awarded on curriculum completion after a user completes a number of credits.
The data will only be viewable by the course recommendation algorithm and a user’s certificate will only be viewable by user.
